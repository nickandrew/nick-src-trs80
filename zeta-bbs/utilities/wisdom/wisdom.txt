Extended Epstein-Heisenberg Principle:
     In an R&D orbit, only 2 of the existing 3 parameters can be defined
     simultaneously. The parameters are: task, time, and resources($).
  1. If one knows what the task is, and there is a time limit allowed
     for completion of the task, then one cannot guess how much it will cost.
  2. If the time and resources are clearly defined, then it is impossible
     to know what part of the R&D task will be performed.
  3. If you are given a clearly defined R&D goal and a definite amount
     of money which has been calculated to be necessary for the completion
     of the task, you cannot predict if and when the goal will be reached.
  Corollary:
     If one is lucky enough and can accurately define all 3 parameters,
     then what one deals with is not in the realm of R&D.

     from the best of all possible efforts to the best that can be expected

        should not have that mark on it.
     2. It will not be discovered until you try to put it where the mark
        says it's supposed to go.

     obvious or extremely simple to anyone with little or no knowledge
     of programming.

  3. Speak with authority; however, only expound on the obvious and
     proven facts.

    1. Things will get worse before they get better.
    2. Who said things would get better?
Everitt's Second Law of Thermodynamics:
     Confusion is always increasing in society. Only if someone or something

   Extra Credit: Define the Universe. Give three examples.
Real programmers don't write specs - users should consider themselves lucky
     to get any programs at all and take what they get.
Real programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should
     be hard to understand.
Real programmers don't write application programs. They program right down to
     the bare metal. Application programming is for feebs who can't do system
     programming.
Real programmers don't eat quiche. In fact, real programmers don't know how
     to spell quiche. They eat twinkles and szechuan food.
Real programmers don't write in COBOL. COBOL is for wimpy applications
     programmers.
Real programmers' programs never work right the first time. But if you throw
     them on the machine, they can be patched into working in 'only a few'
     30-hour debugging sessions.
Real programmers don't write in FORTRAN. FORTRAN is for pipe-stress freaks
     and crystallography weenies.
Real programmers never work 9 to 5. If any real programmers are around at
     9AM, it's because they were up all night.
Real programmers don't write in BASIC. Actually, no programmers write in
     BASIC, after the age of 12.
Real programmers don't write in PL/1. PL/1 is for programmers who can't
     decide whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.
Real programmers don't play tennis or any other sport that requires you to
     change clothes. Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers wear
     their climbing boots to work in case a mountain should suddenly spring up
     in the middle of the machine room.
Real programmers don't document. Documentation is for simps who can't read
     the listings or object deck.
Real programmers don't write in PASCAL or BLISS or ADA, or any of those pinko
     computer science languages. Strong typing is for people with weak memories.
Real programmers don't draw flowcharts. Cavemen drew flowcharts and
     look how much good it did them.
Real programmers don't write in APL, unless the whole program can be
     written on one line.
Real programmers don't write in LISP. Only faggot programs contain more
     parenthesis than actual code.
Real programmers scorn floating-point arithmetic. The decimal point was
     invented for pansy bed wetters who are unable to think big.
Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches. If the vending machine
     sells it, they eat it. If the vending machine doesn't sell it, they
     don't eat it. Vending machines don't sell quiche.
Real programmers like vending-machine popcorn. Coders pop it in the
     microwave oven. Real programmers use the heat from the CPU. They can
     tell which jobs are running from the rate of popping.
Real Programmers disdain structured programming. Structured programming
     is for compulsive neurotics who were prematurely toilet-trained. They
     wear neckties and carefully line up sharp pencils on an otherwise clear
     desk.
Real Programmers don't believe in schedules. Planners make schedules.
     Managers firm up schedules. Frightened coders strive to meet
     schedules. Real programmers ignore schedules.
