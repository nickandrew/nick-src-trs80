          --------- Small-C User Registration (June 1, 1985) -----------
          
          The  Small-C  compiler  is copyrighted material and all rights
          are reserved by the author.  You may use Small-C  in  any  way
          you  please,  except  that  you  may not sell copies without a
          signed agreement  from  the  author.    You  are   encouraged,
          however,  to distribute copies freely so long as you charge no
          more than your actual costs for  just  media,  packaging,  and
          postage.  You must retain all copyright notices and inform the
          recipient  of  his  obligation to the author (next paragraph).
          These terms apply to both source and object Small-C files.
          
          If you received a "free" copy of this  package  (as  described
          above),  you  are  obliged to send a royalty payment of $20 to
          the author, J. E. Hendrix.  Besides satisfying a  moral  debt,
          you  will  be  supporting  further  development of Small-C and
          related software.    Be  sure  to  include  a  copy  of   this
          registration   form   so   you   can  be  informed  of  future
          developments.
          
          This software carries no warranty, either written or  implied,
          regarding  its  performance  or  suitability to any particular
          task.  Neither the author  nor  the  distributor  accepts  any
          responsibility for losses which might derive from its use.
          
          Any   correspondence   requiring   a   reply  must  include  a
          self-addressed, stamped envelope.
