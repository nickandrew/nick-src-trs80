# University Assignments

This directory contains the program output from various subjects
I did at University:

* CPX ... Communications Programming (lecturer: John Kaunitz ?)
* OS ... Operating Systems (lecturer: John Colville ?)
* PT ... Programming Techniques (lecturer: John Hughes)
* SIM ... Simulation (lecturer: Tom Osborn, aka Tomasso)

The programs are undocumented so I don't know what they do. They
are all written in Pascal. Multiple incompatible versions of the same
file are given names suffixed with :01, :02 etc in the order they
were discovered.
