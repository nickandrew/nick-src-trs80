# TRS-80 Games

Text-based adventures and graphical shoot-the-aliens type games
were the dominant games available for the TRS-80. I tried writing
one of each, with partial success, and two other game-type programs
based on personal interests.

I also spent time in the 1980s playing the
[Microsoft Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure)
also known as Colossal Cave. I spent 3 days cracking its copy
protection so I could make backups of my (legally bought) copy.

In 2023 I also spent a considerable amount of time reverse
engineering the game and the result of that work is in the
[colossal-cave](colossal-cave/) subdirectory.

 <dd>This was my space-based shoot-the-aliens game. It is notable
 because each alien was implemented as a little CPU with its own
 set of instructions to execute. These aliens ran their programs
 rather slowly, but the overall speed was not bad. Now if only I
 had coded logic to make them dodge bullets!</dd>

 <dd>This text-based adventure used a data file which was
 assembled into the rest of the game. The data file could be
 replaced with different maps, but I only ever wrote the one.

 <dt>thirty-one</dt>
 <dd>This Pascal program attempts to find whether it is better to be
 player 1 or player 2 at a card game called thirty-one. I don't
 remember the rules of the game.</dd>

 <dd>This Pascal program generates random 4x4 letter substitution
 puzzles. I guess I wrote it cause those puzzles are fun to solve
 in my head without recourse to paper or pencil.</dd>
